Using the linear regression model constructed during the lecture, enter the number of games we expect the team to win:

Exercise 1

&nbsp;Numerical Response&nbsp;

 

Explanation

Our linear regression model was

Wins = 80.88 + 0.1058\*(Run Difference)

Here, the run difference is 99, so our prediction is

Wins = 80.88 + 0.1058\*99 = 91 games.
