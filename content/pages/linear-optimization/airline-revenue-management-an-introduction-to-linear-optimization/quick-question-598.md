## Quick Question

 

In the previous video, we solved our optimization problem in LibreOffice. In your spreadsheet, change the demand for regular seats to 50 (cell D5). Then re-solve the model.

What is the new optimal objective value?

Exercise 1

&nbsp;Numerical Response&nbsp;

 

Now change the demand of regular seats to 200. What is the new optimal objective value?

Exercise 2

&nbsp;Numerical Response&nbsp;

 

Explanation

For each of these questions, change the value in cell D5 to the new demand. Then select "Solver..." in the "Tools" menu, and hit solve. The problem should re-solve, and the new objective value is in the Objective cell (B8).
